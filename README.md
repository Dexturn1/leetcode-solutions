## 📘 Overview

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository** 👋
This repo automatically updates and organizes my Java-based LeetCode submissions by **topic** and **difficulty**, thanks to a custom **GitHub Action** workflow.

Each time I solve a new problem using the [LeetHub Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub-v3/lejdbmnjhcabncgajlfobnnhplnibjcb), the solution is committed and categorized automatically.

### ✅ Features

* 🔄 **Auto-organized** by topic (Array, DP, Tree, etc.)
* 🧠 **Multi-topic support** — problems appear in multiple folders if relevant
* ⚙️ **Automated sorting & pushing** via GitHub Actions
* ☕ **Written in Java**, following clean and consistent code style

## ⚙️ Automation Workflow

This repository uses the GitHub Action file [`leetcode-fresh.yml`](.github/workflows/leetcode-fresh.yml) to:

1. Detect new problems solved via **LeetHub**
2. Execute `sort_by_topic.py` to reorganize solutions
3. Commit & push the updated structure automatically

📄 **Workflow File:**
[`/.github/workflows/leetcode-fresh.yml`](https://github.com/Dexturn1/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/.github/workflows/leetcode-fresh.yml)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Solve a problem on **LeetCode**
2. The **LeetHub extension** pushes the code to this repo
3. GitHub Action sorts and organizes it into topic folders

You’ll find the final solution in the relevant topic directory — for example:

```
📂 /Dynamic Programming
 ┣ 📜 0055-Jump-Game.java
 ┣ 📜 0300-Longest-Increasing-Subsequence.java
```
