## 📘 Overview
Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository** 👋  
Every time I solve a problem on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), this repo automatically updates and organizes the solutions by **topic** and **difficulty** using a custom GitHub Action.

✅ Auto-organized by topic (Array, Backtracking, DP, etc.)  
✅ Supports multiple overlapping categories  
✅ Automatically commits and pushes after each LeetHub submission  

---

> Problems that belong to multiple topics (like Array + DP) appear in **both folders** automatically.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- 🧮 Array  
- 🔁 Linked List

## ⚙️ Automation
This repository uses a **GitHub Action workflow** to:
- Detect new problems solved via [LeetHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub-v3/lejdbmnjhcabncgajlfobnnhplnibjcb)
- Run a Python sorter script (`sort_by_topic.py`)
- Commit & push the organized files automatically  

Action File:  
[`/.github/workflows/leetcode-fresh.yml`](https://github.com/Dexturn1/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/.github/workflows/leetcode-fresh.yml)

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Solve any problem on **LeetCode** with the **LeetHub extension**  
2. LeetHub pushes the solution to this repo automatically  
3. GitHub Action runs and organizes the solution by topic  
4. Folder structure updates itself neatly 🧹  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
- **Java** – primary language for all solutions  
- **Python (Automation)** – for sorting and structuring files  
- **GitHub Actions** – for continuous integration
